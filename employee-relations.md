# Employee Relations

One of the benefits of a community meetup is the ability to put professionals in touch with those who need help from said professionals.

We need help putting those people in touch with each other.

## Role

However you'd like, organize an approach to facilitating effective communication between job hunters and job seekers. Bring some synergy to the equation and connect those dots. Reach out! Touch those bases!
