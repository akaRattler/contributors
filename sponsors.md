## Wanna Sponsor?

Let's be honest, [I want money, that's what I want](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGWJ9f1rIio).

Running a good meetup takes a little bit of money. 

If you or your company is interested in providing a sponsorship, either one-time or recurring, we'd love to have your help. Of course, it doesn't have to be Joe's money that you provide. We also welcome any sort of giveaway or discount you're interested in.

If you'd like to talk details before committing, [get in touch via the meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/San-Antonio-JavaScript-User-Group/).
