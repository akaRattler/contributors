# Contributors

These are all the great people who contribute to Hill Country JS, and how they contribute. Anyone is welcome to add their name to the list!

## How this works

Just like any good open source project is kept alive by an army of contributors, Hill Country JS needs your help with all the little things. We're looking for contributors to take on small roles that they're interested.

In [the issues queue](https://github.com/hillcountryjs/contributors/issues) are roles that need contributions. If you find a role you're interested in, submit a pull request that adds your name to the list.
